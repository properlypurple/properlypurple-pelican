    <p>I'm just back from the <a href="http://2016.gnome.asia/">GNOME.Asia Summit 2016</a>, and I must say that I'm equally exhilarated and humbled by the whole conference. The summit was a 3 day event, organized by the GNOME Asia team, and supported by the GNOME Foundation. There were a lot of GNOME Foundation members and directors at the event apart from attendees and speakers from various parts of the world.</p>
<p>The best thing about attending this event was the amazingÂ  sense of community. Everyone I met and talked to, regardless of their experience or position, was extremely polite, humble, and encouraging. I sincerely believe that the sense of belonging that you get in a community, especially in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free Software</a> one, cannot be paralleled by the so-called "Networking" in traditional conferences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between a network and community is that a network belongs to you, while you belong to a community.<br>
<cite>Zygmunt Bauman</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I met a lot of people from different countries and cultures, and made a lot of new friends. There was no exchange of business cards, only good wishes and heart-to-heart talks. I can honestly say that this has been the happiest conference I've ever attended, and I can't wait to go again next time.</p>
<p><em>Hundreds of thanks to everyone responsible for organizing, and thanks everyone attending for making this such a feel-good event. :)</em></p>
<p>UPDATE: For pictures of the event, you can go to <a href="https://flic.kr/g/rHL1i">this Flickr group</a>.</p>
