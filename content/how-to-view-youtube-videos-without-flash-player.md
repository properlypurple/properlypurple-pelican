Many times it happens that you dont have the latest version of flash player and youtube doesn't work on the older one. Well here's a trick that lets you watch them without flash player installed. Moreover, it gives you the options to directly view the HD/HQ version of a video(if available), and a link to download the video. Let's go

Step1  - If you are using Mozilla Firefox, go to step 2. If not download and install it from [here](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/upgrade.html).

Step2  - Install the Greasemonkey plugin by clicking [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/downloads/latest/748/addon-748-latest.xpi?src=search).

Step3  - Install Linterna Magica
