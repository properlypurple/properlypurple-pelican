Welcome to my new blog. Okay, this is not a new blog, but an old blog with a new .blog. Interesting, right :D`<!--more-->`{=html}

I finally got my hands on a domain worth using(thank you Automattic :D), so this blog is now available on [properlypurple.com](https://properlypurple.com/). Cool, right.

.blog is a new `<abbr title="Top level domain">`{=html}tld`</abbr>`{=html}, and you can get your own by going to [get.blog](https://get.blog). You can connect it to your [shiny new WordPress.com blog](https://wordpress.com/start/), or host it yourselves, on any web host. If you're not sure if you need it, watch this video by Matt Mullenweg.
