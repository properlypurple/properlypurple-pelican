How can I not. I went last year, and I learnt a lot. But this year, I'm going to be a speaker, and my topic is "Better WordPress Development with Vagrant". Yay :D

Now for those of you who don't know about WordCamp(WHY??), here is a small description

> [WordCamps](http://central.wordcamp.org/ "WordCamp Central") are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users all around the year at different locations.

Mumbai is a very happening place when it comes to WordPress and community participation, and the fine guys at [WP India](https://wpindia.org/) have been organizing WordCamp Mumbai since 2012. This is going to be an awesome event with a boatload of good speakers and a lot of community engagement, contact building and stuff. If you want to get a dose of all the awesome, you can check out the list of speakers [here](http://2015.mumbai.wordcamp.org/speakers/), and buy some tickets [here.](http://mumbai.wordcamp.org/2015/tickets/)

See you there.
