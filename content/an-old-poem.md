This poem has been moved from my old blog. I wrote it maybe 6-7 years ago, when I used to be in the existentialistic teen-age. :) Enjoy, maybe..

*Take my life*  
*Or give me a reason to live*  
*For all these years I’ve lived*  
*are like stones in a lake*  
*Sinking as they touch*

*Take my hand*  
*And lead me to a world*  
*where people don’t think*  
*For all these thoughts i thought*  
*are washed away by them*  
*And their inhibitions*

*Take my breathe*  
*and let me wake up*  
*from a world of dreams*  
*For all the dreams i saw*  
*were shattered to pieces*  
*on ground of reality*

*Take my eyes*  
*and let me be blind*  
*so I see nothing*  
*For all these things I saw*  
*were fake as a mirage*  
*just seeming to be real*

*Take my soul*  
*and let me be a stone*  
*so I feel nothing*  
*For all these things I felt*  
*were happy illusions*  
*as mean as they could be*

*Or take my heart*  
*and fill it with love*  
*So I have nothing*  
*but you in my arms*  
*And the world stares at me*  
*as jealous as it could be……*
