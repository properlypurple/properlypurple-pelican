Bucket List
-----------

Seeing a lot of people writing down their bucket lists, I decided to write my own. There are lots that I have already done, and will be added at some point.

### Short term

-   TBD

### Long term

-   Never retire
-   Climb the highest mountain on a continent
-   Run a full marathon
-   Go to space
-   Complete a triathlon

I'll add more once I remember more. ðŸ˜€
