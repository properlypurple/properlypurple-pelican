Every step I took, 
brought me closer to today. 
Every step I take, 
takes me closer 
to the promise of a tomorrow, 
where the clouds are silver,
and the mist hugs you 
like an old friend of cold fire. 

Every moment of today, 
is another step to that far-flung future 
where the fire is ice and the
 road with the yellow bricks 
takes me home â€” home, 
where I am me;
 undoubtedly, completely,
 and unapologetically, me.
