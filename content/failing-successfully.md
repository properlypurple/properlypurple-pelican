It was the end of 2008. I had just returned after failing in the test to be a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force. I was sitting with two of my best friends, with whom I had just finished building a social network in ASP classic a few months ago. We had this crazy idea of making web things for other people instead of going to college, and that's where my entrepreneurial journey started.

Just a few months from that moment, in March of 2009, we started an agency called coNetFun Studios. Little did we know that the path we had put ourselves on was going to be one full of challenges, pain, failure, learning, and what not. We were young, and had no idea about what was coming. All three of us enrolled in different colleges, because we needed graduate degrees of some sort if we were to live peacefully in this country.
