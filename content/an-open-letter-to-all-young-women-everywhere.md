Hi there!

I have many things to say to you. But there are two things that I want to say the most.


First, on behalf of the completely fucked-up thing called the human society, I am sorry.

Second, you are beautiful, inside and out, and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.

You must be thinking, what does this privileged young man has to say to me, who does he think he is, and how dare he tell us anything. You may be right, or you may be wrong, and I'm not going to argue. What I'm going to do instead, is pour my heart out for you to choose and listen.

Now, if you've reached this point, I'll assume you're interested, so I'll go on and keep regurgitating my thoughts from this privileged position, of being born in a body with a Y chromosome in my cells, and a penis on my body.

When you're little, people will tell you that you're a princess. When you start growing up, they will tell you you're hot. Some will have more colourful names — slut, whore, bitch, and what not. What I want to say to you, is that whatever they call you, it doesn't change what you are, or who you are.

People will invent names for you based on the shape and size of your body, but that doesn't make you superior or inferior from anyone else.

People will try to put you down, but don't stop getting up.

People will try to put you on a pedestal, but try to stay on the ground.

You'll be judged on your choice of education, don't worry about it. Even if you don't like it, learn a bit about science.

You'll be judged on your choice of clothes, don't pay attentions to those people, and keep wearing what makes you feel good.

You'll be judged about what(and how much) you eat. I say flip those people off and keep eating what you want, and how much you want(just take care of your health, and don't forget calcium and vitamin D; You'll thank me later :) )

You'll be judged on who you love. I promise you that it doesn't matter who you love, as long as you're honest to yourself. If you get heartbroken, you get to learn how to get back up, so do it.

You'll be forced to do many things, but you are the one who has ultimate power over yourself. Do what you think is right, even if it means failing. How else are you going to learn how to pick yourself up?

If you don't want to cook, don't.

If you don't want to get married, don't.

If you don't want kids, don't have them.

You'll be judged on what you decide to do with your life. I say if you want to be a mechanic, or an astronaut, or a doctor, or a lumberjack, or a biker, or whatever, if you decide in your mind what your goal is, there is no force in this world that can stop you.

There will always be people trying to make you do what they want; systems that are too ingrained in our natures that will make you lose belief in goodness. But if you give up and give in, there's nothing that can help us.

Just remember that gender is just a construct, that we use to divide people in categories. You might have some features I don't, and I might have some you don't, but that doesn't make one superior or inferior. Just imagine if all parts of a car were the same, would it even be possible to build it.

Just remember that if you feel lost, or down, there are always people who love you. All you need to do is recognize who those are.

There will always be people who will try to make you feel unimportant, unwanted, and insignificant. There will be men and women and others who will try your patience, who will make you question your very existence, but if you believe in yourself, you will come out victorious.

You are not alone, but you don't need anyone else to define yourselves. You don't need validation from anyone else to be complete. This doesn't mean that you have to be a loner, just that no other person can become what you are to yourselves.

There will be times when you start to hate yourself. Believe me when I say this, there is no shame in making mistakes. There is no bigger opportunity for learning than making a mistake.

You will always know who you are, even if you don't feel like it. You don't need a *mind vomit* like this one to tell you who you are, or what you can be. I can only hope that if my words are any comfort to you, or if they inspire you to be yourself to your fullest potential, I will consider this to be a worthwhile effort.

 

With all the love in the world. \<3
