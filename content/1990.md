I almost didn't write this, but I've been adding small improvements to the Relativity theme over the last 1 year, and this version is a fruit of all of them. The changes in short are below. Details and screenshots will be further down:

## Five point oh

The biggest thing about this update, is that the theme properly supports the new block editor shipped with WordPress 5.0+, dubbed the Gutenberg editor. There has been almost-good support for the editor since Gutenberg came out, but now it's much better, well-tested, and better looking overall.
