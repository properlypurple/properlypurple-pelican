This is a stepwell, around 10-11 km from my native village, in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, India. If you don't know what a stepwell is, read about [stepwells on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwell).

Taken in 2012 with a puny Samsung phone running Bada OS, slightly editedÂ  on Google Photos for colour correction.
